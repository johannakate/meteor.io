    <h2 class="pagetitle">Our team</h2>

    <p>
      We're a small, close-knit group of writers, evangelists, event organizers, designers, product
      devs, systems experts, and many other things. We accomplish a remarkable amount of work for our
      size because we're passionate about what we do and we have grand aspirations of making software
      development as fast, easy, and accessible as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      We love building tools for developers because we're all nerds at heart. Many of us come from a
      technical background. Our founders originally met as undergrads at MIT, and created the Meteor
      platform after inadvertently writing most of it to power their original idea, a travel app for iPads.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      Of all our accomplishments at Meteor, what I'm most proud of is the team. It's a privilege and an
      honor to work with such a talented and caring group of people.
    </p>
    <p class="speaker">- Nick Martin, CTO/Co-Founder</p>
